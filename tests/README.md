# Description of tests

## Simple tests

This folder contains very simple test cases meant to check whether the error reporting system is working properly:

- `test1` and `test3` should parse without errors;
- `test2` should have lexer and parser errors;
- `test4` should have only lexer errors.

## Extended tests

We also have certain standard specification to use as examples:

- `cographs` is a symbolic grammar describing cographs, following the split decomposition framework of Bahrani and Lumbroso (2017).
